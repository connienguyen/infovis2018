Salam,Syria,Refugee,Female,22,Falkenberg,"Eftergymnasial utbildning, mindre än 3 år.",Unemployed.,"""We saw how the rockets and the bombs flew through the air above us.""","My life before the war was nice and calm. I lived with my mother and my siblings. I managed to graduate from high school, an important achievement in my life. We decided to flee, leaving Syria in 2015. First, we went to Lebanon and then to Turkey. From there we would cross the sea to Greece. That was the worst part of the trip. Sweden is a beautiful and modern country. But my expectations were proven wrong. I waited ten months to get an interview with the Migration Agency. I still live in a refugee camp. I have not been able to start studying yet.",http://pejl.svt.se/syrien200/en/stories/82,/img/profile_salam.jpg,Syria15-24-years
